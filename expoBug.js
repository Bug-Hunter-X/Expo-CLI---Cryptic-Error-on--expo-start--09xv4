While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  I was attempting to run `expo start` to launch the development server, but it would consistently fail with a cryptic error message. The message was not specific enough to pinpoint the cause. I've tried various troubleshooting steps, including clearing the cache, reinstalling Expo CLI, updating Node.js and npm, and checking my project dependencies, but none of them resolved the issue.
