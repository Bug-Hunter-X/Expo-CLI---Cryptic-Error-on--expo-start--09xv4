// expoBugSolution.js
// This solution requires a detailed investigation of the original error message.
// The following is a placeholder.  A real solution would depend on the specific nature of the original cryptic error.

// Example:  If the error was related to a missing dependency:
// npm install missing-dependency 

// Example: If the error was related to a corrupted install:
// npm cache clean --force
npm install

// Example: If the error was related to incorrect configuration in app.json:
// Correct the configuration issue as found in app.json. For example adjust the SDK version or other relevant parameters.

//After resolving the root cause, run expo start again.
