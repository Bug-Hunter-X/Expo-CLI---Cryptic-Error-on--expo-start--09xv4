## Solution

The solution to this issue is provided in `expoBugSolution.js`. Detailed analysis and fixes may include:

- Carefully examining the complete output of the `expo start` command, including any warnings or hints.
- Investigating potentially conflicting dependencies using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
- Checking for any problems in `package.json` or `app.json` configuration files.
